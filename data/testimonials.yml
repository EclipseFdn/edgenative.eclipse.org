    title: Evan Xiao, Vice president, Strategy and Industry Development, Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd 
    text: Building a strong open ecosystem community for the emerging geo-distributed Edge Native platform is fundamentally important to the success of IoT across various industry sectors. While edge devices are heterogeneous and domain specific, they share much common decentralized software characteristics towards IT, CT, and OT convergence. We are thrilled to participate in the Eclipse Edge Native working group as contributors to building a unified open distributed edge framework for discovering, sharing, and moving data, as well as storage, analytics, and governance across heterogeneous clients, edges, and clouds.

    title: Kilton Hopkins, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Edgeworx, Inc.
    text: The Eclipse Foundation is doing the same thing for edge computing that it did for IoT. We’re acknowledging that edge computing has its own requirements, challenges, and industry-wide concerns that are different from those found in all other sectors. There’s enough going on in the industry that it’s time to address the particular challenges associated with edge computing in a very focused way.
